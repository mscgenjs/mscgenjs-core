# MsGenny

_**Low effort labeling. Auto declarations**_

mscgen already is a simple, concise, well readable language. Write-ability
leaves room for improvement, though.
The _MsGenny_ language is our attempt to fill that room. It does away with some of
MscGen's more fancy features in favor of low effort labeling
and automatic entity declarations. This enables you to set up a sequence chart _very_
fast. See below for a complete comparison chart.

To have our cake and eat it too we made the mscgen_js [online interpreter][4] translate between
the two with the flick of a switch. The interpreter also contains a complete [tutorial][5]
on _MsGenny_.

## Example

```msgenny
a -> b : ab();
a => c : automatically declares entities used in arcs;
c =>> c : process(1);
b <<= c : Has all mscgen arc types... ;
b note b: ...notes + boxes ...;
|||;
--- : Labels usually don't need enclosing quotes;
--- : "except when they contain , or ;";
...;
```

this renders as

The equivalent mscgen program would have looked like this:

```mscgen
msc {
  a, b, c;

  a -> b [label="ab()"];
  a => c [label="automatically declares entities used in arcs"];
  c =>> c [label="process(1)"];
  b <<= c [label="Has all mscgen arc types... "];
  b note b [label="...notes + boxes ..."];
  |||;
  --- [label="Labels usually don't need enclosing quotes"];
  --- [label="except when they contain , or ;"];
  ...;
}
```

## Usage scenarios

We often find ourselves starting a sequence chart in _MsGenny_, and, when
we're done, converting it to _MscGen_ (one click in the on line interpreter). After
that we either finish it with coloring or directly save the source to
the documentation.

When in a hurry we directly use the rendered output from _MsGenny_.

## A note on quotes

Just like in _MscGen_, in _MsGenny_ labels need to be surrounded by quotes.
To simplify entry, however, in most cases _MsGenny_ allows you to
skip the quotes. It only needs quotes when a label contains a comma or a
semicolon:

```msgenny
    a => b : "hello b";  # works
    a => b :  hello b;   # works
    a => b : "hello; b"; # works
    a => b :  hello; b;  # doesn't work; confuses the parser to think the arc line stops after hello
    a => b : "hello, b"; # works
    a => b :  hello, b;  # doesn't work; confuses the parser to think the arc stops after hello
```

## Formal syntax

The formal syntax is described in a [parsing expression grammar][1]. This grammar
is used to generate the MsGenny parser as well.

## Feature comparison

As mentioned above the [online interpreter][4] converts between _MscGen_ and _MsGenny_,
but the [command line interface][2] also does:

```sh
# Translate MsGenny => MscGen
mscgen_js -T mscgen -i yourchart.msgenny -o yourchart.mscgen

# Translate MscGen => MsGenny
mscgen_js -T msgenny -i yourchart.mscgen -o yourchart.msgenny
```
