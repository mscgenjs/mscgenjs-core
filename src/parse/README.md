# Parsing

The parsers for `mscgen`, `msgenny` and `xù` are written in
peggy and deliver the abstract syntax tree as a javascript
object. In this section we describe

- [how to generate the parsers from peggy](#generating-the-parsers)
- [the structure of and principles behind the abstract syntax trees](#the-abstract-syntax-tree)

## Generating the parsers

To create javascript from the .peggy source usable in node and
commonjs:

```bash
peggy --format umd -o mscgenparser.js mscgenparser.peggy
```

(To create a parser that is usable with require.js, we used to need
a script that did some magic replacements - with peggy' `--format umd`
option that's no longer necessary.)

## The abstract syntax tree

All parsers generate a JSON syntax tree that consist of three
parts that make up mscgen programs:

- options
- entities
- arcs.

We will discuss each in detail below.

> :information_source: When you add `debug=true` to the url of the
> online interpreter (https://sverweij.github.io/mscgen_js?debug=true)
> it gets an extra language option called "AST". When you click it,
> the editor will show the abstract syntax tree the parser
> generated.
>
> If you are brave and/ or have too much time on your
> hands you can even edit the syntax tree directly from there.

In the explanation we will use this mscgen program as a reference.

```mscgen
# Just a sample chart. Don't think too much of it :-).
msc {
  hscale="1.1",
  width="700",
  arcgradient="10",
  wordwraparcs="true";

  a [label="Entity A", textcolor="white", textbgcolor="red"],
  b [label="Entity B", textbgcolor="yellow"],
  c [label="Entity C", textcolor="yellow", textbgcolor="blue"];

  a -> b [label="do something"];
  b >> a [label="working on it"],  b => c [label="do something"]; # parallel call
  c >> b [label="done; results"];
  b >> a [label="done"];
}
```

### general conventions

- _Be liberal in what you receive and strict in what you send_  
  although mscgen (, msgenny, xù) often support multiple spellings
  of attributes and options and are case insensitive the parser
  outputs only one variant of them in - lowercase (e.g. TEXTcolor,
  textColor and TeXtColOUR all translate to the
  attribute "textcolor")
  - American spelling (e.g. textcolor and textcolour both translate
    to the
    attribute "textcolor")
  - "true" and "false" as values for booleans
- _If it's not in the input, it's not in the output_  
  The parser does not generate "default values" for objects whose
  pendant was not available in the input.
- _No order guarantees, except for arrays_
  - The order of attributes within arrays is guaranteed to be the same
    as in the source program.
  - For all other objects the order is not guaranteed.
- TODO: describe escape mechanism

### options

`options` is an object with the options that are possible in
mscgen as attributes.

- If the input program does not have an option, the associated
  attribute won't be in the syntax tree either.
- If the input program does not have any options at all, the
  syntax tree won't have an options object.
- Note that in mscgen, msgenny and xù the boolean attribute
  `wordwraparcs` can have
  - the values _true_, _1_, _on_, _"true"_ and _"on"_ for _true_ and
  - _false_, _0_, _off_, _"false"_ and _"off"_ for _false_.  
    The parser flattens this to "true" and "false" respectively so
    consumers working with the syntax tree don't have to worry
    about it.

```json
  "options": {
    "arcgradient": "10",
    "hscale": "1.1",
    "width": "700",
    "wordwraparcs": "true"
  }
```

### entities

`entities` is an array of anonymous objects, each of which
represents an entity. Each of these objects is guaranteed to have
a `name` attribute. To remain compatible with mscgen this name
is /not necessarily unique/, however.

The list of possible attributes is equal to what is allowed for mscgen:

"id", "url", "idurl", "linecolor", "textcolor", "textbgcolor", "arclinecolor", "arctextcolor", "arctextbgcolor"

- Note that mscgen allows its color attributes to be written in
  either British or American spelling (colour, color). The mscgen,
  msgenny and xù parsers all map them to the American variant for the
  ease of its consumers. - Shrewd readers will have noticed the
  parser allows "arcskip" as well, while in the context of an entity
  it is meaningless. The reason for its pressence is simply that the
  mscgen and xù parsers use the same list of attributes for entities
  as for arcs. Consumers are advised to ignore the arcskip attribute
  for entities (our code certainly does :-)).

```json
"entities": [
    {
      "name": "a",
      "label": "Entity A",
      "textbgcolor": "red",
      "textcolor": "white"
    },
    {
      "name": "b",
      "label": "Entity B",
      "textbgcolor": "yellow"
    },
    {
      "name": "c",
      "label": "Entity C",
      "textbgcolor": "blue",
      "textcolor": "yellow"
    }
  ]
```

### arcs

`arcs` is a two dimensional array of arcs. Each array in the
outer array represents an arc _row_ (so the name _arcs_ is kind of
a misnomer - ah well). The inner array consists of anonymous objects
each of which represents an arc. Each arc is guaranteed to have the
_kind_ attribute. Most arcs also have a _from_ and a _to_.
_from_ and _to_ reference an entity by its _name_. The special value "\*"
denotes _all enttities_.

Other attributes are optional: "url", "id", "idurl", "linecolor", "textcolor", "textbgcolor", "arcskip"

Actually, "arclinecolor", "arctextcolor" and "arctextbgcolor" are
allowed too, but as they have no functional meaning in the context
of an arc consumers are advised to ignore them for arcs.

todo: add recursive structure for xù.

```json
  ...

  "arcs": [
    [
      {
        "kind": "->",
        "from": "a",
        "to": "b",
        "label": "do something"
      }
    ],

    ...
```

In the sample mscgen `b` communicates to `a` that it is working on
something, while _at the same time_ instructing `c` to do something.
Syntax tree snippet:

```json
    ...
    [
      {
        "kind": ">>",
        "from": "b",
        "to": "a",
        "label": "working on it"
      },
      {
        "kind": "=>",
        "from": "b",
        "to": "c",
        "label": "do something"
      }
    ],
    ...
```

### recursive arcs in xù and msgenny

xù and msgenny both support "inline expressions", which
can contain other arcs and inline expressions.

In the abstract syntax tree an inline expression is an "arc", just
as they are in xù and msgenny.

```mscgen
msc {
  a, b;

  a loop b [label="for all things"] {
    a opt b [label="thing is worth its while"]{
      a => b [label="thingify (thing)"];
    };
  };
}
```

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "a"
    },
    {
      "name": "b"
    }
  ],
  "arcs": [
    [
      {
        "kind": "loop",
        "from": "a",
        "to": "b",
        "label": "for all things",
        "arcs": [
          [
            {
              "kind": "opt",
              "from": "a",
              "to": "b",
              "label": "thing is worth its while",
              "arcs": [
                [
                  {
                    "kind": "=>",
                    "from": "a",
                    "to": "b",
                    "label": "thingify (thing)"
                  }
                ]
              ]
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Comments

The parser strips all comments from the source, which makes processing the
abstract syntax tree a lot simpler. It turned out that it was easy to save
comments that go on top of the source, without generating undue complexity.
In the AST they show up somewhere at the top, like this:

```json
"precomment": [
  "# Just a sample chart. Don't think too much of it :-).",
  "\n"
]
```

### Meta information

The three languages mscgen_js supports, have different feature sets. To
indicate if the AST uses extended feature sets, it contains a `meta` section.

```json
"meta": {
  "extendedOptions": false,
  "extendedArcTypes": false,
  "extendedFeatures": false
}
```

- `extendedOptions` - `true` when the AST contains a non standard option.
  (currently only `watermark`).
- `extendedArcTypes` - `true` when the AST contains at least one
  _inline expression_.
- `extendedFeatures` - `true` when the AST contains _extended options_,
  _extended features_ or both.
